# JavaScript Tetris Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the player to control the movement and rotation of Tetromino blocks as they fall down the game board. The player can score points by completing rows of blocks, and the game ends when the blocks reach the top of the board.

## Features

- Random generation of Tetromino blocks
- Movement and rotation of Tetromino blocks using arrow keys
- Automatic dropping of Tetromino blocks at regular intervals
- Collision detection and prevention of overlapping blocks
- Scoring of points for completed rows of blocks
- End game when the Tetromino blocks reach the top of the board

## Installation

To run the game, simply download the project files and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game should run in the browser window.

## Usage

To start the game, click the "Start Game" button on the game board. The Tetromino blocks will start falling down the board, and the player can use the arrow keys to move and rotate the blocks.

The player can score points by completing rows of blocks. When a row is completed, the blocks in that row will be removed and the player will receive points based on the number of blocks removed.

The game ends when the Tetromino blocks reach the top of the board. The player's score will be displayed in an alert box.

To restart the game, click the "Start Game" button again.
